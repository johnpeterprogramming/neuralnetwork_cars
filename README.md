# neuralnetwork_cars
This Godot Project uses Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies to evolve my artificial neural network.
The neural network takes 5 distances from the car as inputs and the output decides how to turn.
I learned to code neural network and genetic algorithms from scratch in this project aswell as bettering my gdscipt and Godot skills.
